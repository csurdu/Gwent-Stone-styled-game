Introduction
Welcome to the world of GwentStone! You are the fresh entrepreneurs of the "OOP-Everything" studio, with the mission to create a computer card game that combines elements from Hearthstone and Gwent. Your game promises to be a unique experience, featuring innovative mechanics and a captivating story for the created characters.

Technical Details of the Game
The game can be played by two players in a friendly mode, and in the current development stage, an AI will simulate the actions of the second player. The server will provide you with game and debugging commands, and it is your responsibility to respond to these commands to maintain the coherence and functionality of the game.

Brief Overview of the Gameplay
GwentStone involves two players, each with multiple decks of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a hero, and a coin flip determines who starts. The game unfolds in rounds and turns, with each player receiving "mana" at the start of the round, drawing a card from the deck, and placing cards on the table to battle. Heroes have special abilities, and cards can have various effects and abilities.

Game Board
The game board is a 4x5 matrix, with each player having two allocated rows. Cards are placed on the board, and effects can affect cards in a specific row. Coordinates are used to identify the position of cards in tests.

Card Formats
There are three main types of cards: Minion, Environment, and Hero.

Feel free to consult the documentation for detailed information on these card types and their specific attributes, rules, and effects.

These are the key aspects of the GwentStone project. You have the resources and creativity to make this game a success! Good luck in development!
